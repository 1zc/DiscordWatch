# DiscordWatch
A suite of plugins to keep an eye on player/staff actions in your servers, via Discord.

CallAdmin, SourceBans and SourceComms modules originated from Zipcore: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=292663

Feature enhancements done to existing modules include:
- Timestamps in footer of embeds (Discord is notorious for not posting webhooks immediately)
- Listed Steam ID's for reporters and targets (easier to search and view)
- Clickable Steam ID's through to Steam profiles for quick access
- SourceBans/Comms: Added field that lists the server the enforcement originated from
- CallAdmin module now supports more than one role ping, currently is terribly hardcoded to certain phrases so I'd suggest staying away
- ...and more coming!

## New Modules
- Kick Module
- Rename Module
